### Step 4: Submitting Feedback on Github Actions Documentation

**Rating:** Positive

**Feedback:** I found the GitHub Actions Quickstart guide to be exceptionally clear and well-structured. The step-by-step instructions were easy to follow, and I appreciated how the guide explains exactly where to create files and what to name them. However, it would be helpful to include more explanations about what the Github Actions script actually does. I think something as simple as saying "this script will print a few lines and clone a repository" would be very helpful to confirm things such as "echo" and "uses: action/checkout@4". Additionally, a simple diagram showing how runners, workflows, and repositories connect would provide valuable context for first-time users.
